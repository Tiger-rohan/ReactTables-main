# React Table Tutorial

This is a tutorial project that demonstrates how to use the `@tanstack/react-table` library to create a table in a React application. The table includes features such as sorting, filtering, editing, pagination, and column sorting.

## Technologies Used

- React
- @chakra-ui/react
- @tanstack/react-table
- react-datepicker

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

## Features

- Sorting
- Filtering
- Editing
- Date picker
- Custom status cell
- Custom filter popover
- Pagination
- Column sorting

## How it Works

The table is defined using a `columns` array and a `data` array. The `useReactTable` hook is used to manage the state of the table, including sorting, filtering, and editing. The `Filters` component is used to display the filter options and apply them to the table. The `DateCell` and `EditableCell` components are used to customize the appearance of the cells. The `StatusCell` component is used to display a custom status icon and filter options.
